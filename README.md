Welcome to my digital playground! 🌸 I’m diving deep into the world of blockchain, especially with Solidity and Rust, 
and I’m super excited to keep learning more. 
I’m all about collaboration and contribution—nothing gets me more fired up than working on awesome projects with amazing people.
Need a hackathon teammate? Don’t wait—hit me up, and let’s make some magic happen! ✨

## 👀 What gets me excited:
- DeFi, because who doesn’t love decentralized money? 💸
- Writing smart contracts that are  clever 😋
- Making Rust less rusty and more robust 🚀

## 🌱 Currently nurturing my brain with:
- Leveling up my Solidity wizardry 🧙‍♀️
- Turning Rust into gold—performance gold, that is! ⚙️

## 💞️ Let’s team up on:
- Solidity projects (let’s make those contracts sparkle ✨)
- Rust blockchain ventures (because who needs bugs when you’ve got style? 🐞)

- 🐦 Feeling chirpy? Tweet me on the Birdy app: @LydiaAhenkorah

⚡ Fun fact: Why did the Solidity dev bring a ladder to the bar? Because she heard the drinks were on the house! 🥂
